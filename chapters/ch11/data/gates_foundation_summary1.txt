Our focus on access and equity is fundamental to our current and future work with AI.
These principles will be refined and adapted as we engage with partners and other outside experts, as we learn based on experience, and as future developments in AI technology evolve.
Our approach to the use of AI technology is therefore grounded in the need to promote greater equity and opportunity for resource-poor communities.
These are early days in the development of AI and its uses to better human health and development.
