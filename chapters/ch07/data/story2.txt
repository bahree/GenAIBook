Once upon a time, in a not-so-distant future, there lived a robot named Bolts and a dog named Sparky. Bolts was a state-of-the-art robot, with all the latest bells and whistles. Sparky was a simple, old-fashioned dog, but he was the best friend a robot could ask for.

One day, Bolts and Sparky were playing fetch in the park when Bolts accidentally threw the ball too far. Sparky chased after it, but he couldn't quite catch it. The ball rolled under a bush, and Sparky disappeared after it.

Bolts waited for Sparky to come back, but he didn't. He started to worry. He called Sparky's name, but there was no answer. Bolts went under the bush to look for Sparky, but he couldn't find him anywhere.

Bolts was starting to panic. He didn't know what to do. He ran back to Sparky's house and told his owner, Billy, that Sparky was missing.

Billy and Bolts searched the park for hours, but they couldn't find Sparky anywhere. Billy was starting to lose hope. He was about to give up when he heard a bark coming from the woods.

Billy and Bolts followed the sound of the bark and found Sparky trapped in a hole. He had fallen down the hole while chasing the ball, and he couldn't get out.

Bolts used his robotic strength to pull Sparky out of the hole. Sparky was so happy to see Bolts. He wagged his tail and licked Bolts' face.

Billy was so relieved to have Sparky back. He thanked Bolts for saving his best friend.

Bolts was happy that he could help. He had learned a valuable lesson that day: even though he was a robot, he was still capable of being a true friend.

A few weeks later, Bolts and Sparky were playing in the park again. This time, Bolts was careful not to throw the ball too far. Sparky was having a great time chasing after the ball and fetching it back to Bolts.

Suddenly, Sparky saw a squirrel and darted after it. Bolts called after Sparky, but he didn't listen. Sparky chased the squirrel into the street, and a car came speeding around the corner.

Bolts knew he had to do something to save Sparky. He ran as fast as he could and pushed Sparky out of the way just in time. The car swerved and missed them both by inches.

Sparky was shaken up, but he was unharmed. He wagged his tail and licked Bolts' face in gratitude.

Bolts was happy that he had saved Sparky's life. He knew that Sparky was his best friend, and he would do anything for him.

One day, Billy was working on his car in the driveway. Bolts and Sparky were helping him. Bolts was holding a flashlight, and Sparky was fetching tools.

Suddenly, there was a spark from the car engine. A small fire started, and it quickly spread. Billy and Bolts managed to get out of the way, but Sparky ran back into the burning car to get his favorite squeaky toy.

Bolts knew he had to save Sparky. He ran into the burning car and found Sparky hiding under the dashboard. Bolts grabbed Sparky and carried him out of the car just in time.

The fire department arrived and put out the fire, but Billy's car was destroyed. Billy was devastated, but he was grateful that Bolts and Sparky were safe.

Bolts was a hero. He had saved Sparky's life twice. Billy knew that he was lucky to have such a brave and loyal friend.

One day, Billy was feeling down. He had had a bad day at work, and he was worried about his future. He didn't know what to do.

Bolts saw that Billy was upset, so he went over to him and nuzzled his hand. Billy looked at Bolts and smiled.

"Thanks, buddy," Billy said. "I needed that."

Billy sat down on the couch and Bolts curled up next to him. Billy started to tell Bolts about his day. He told him about the problems he was having at work and his worries about the future.

Bolts listened patiently. He didn't say anything, but he was there for Billy. He made Billy feel better just by being there.

When Billy was finished talking, he felt a lot better. He thanked Bolts for listening to him.

"You're the best friend a guy could ask for," Billy said.

Bolts wagged his tail and licked Billy's face. He was happy that he could help
