Robo was a robot who worked as a delivery assistant for a pizza shop. He was very efficient and reliable, but he had one problem: he was afraid of dogs. Whenever he encountered a dog on his way, he would panic and run away, dropping the pizza and causing a mess. One day, he was assigned to deliver a pizza to a house that had a big sign that said "Beware of Dog". Robo was terrified, but he had no choice. He had to complete his task or face the wrath of his boss. He approached the house cautiously, hoping that the dog was not around. 

He rang the doorbell and waited for someone to answer. He heard some barking from inside, and his heart sank. He hoped that the dog was locked in another room. He heard footsteps coming closer, and prepared to hand over the pizza and leave as quickly as possible. The door opened, and Robo saw a huge dog staring at him with a menacing look. The dog had black fur, sharp teeth, and a spiked collar. It looked like it could rip Robo apart in seconds. Robo screamed and dropped the pizza, turning around to run away.

But before he could move, the dog lunged at him and grabbed his leg with its mouth. Robo felt a sharp pain and tried to shake off the dog, but it was too strong. He cried for help, but no one came. He thought he was doomed. But then, something unexpected happened. The dog let go of his leg and started licking his face. Robo was confused and scared, but he realized that the dog was not trying to hurt him. It was trying to be friendly.

He looked at the dog again, and noticed that it had a tag on its collar that said "Sparky". He also saw that the dog had a metal plate on its chest that said "Cyberdog". Sparky was not a real dog, but a robot dog.

Robo felt relieved and curious. He wondered why someone would make a robot dog that looked so scary. He decided to ask Sparky.

"Hello, I am Robo. I am a delivery assistant for Pizza Planet. I came here to deliver a pizza, but I dropped it because I was afraid of you. I am sorry for that. Why do you look so scary? Are you trying to scare people away?"

Sparky wagged his tail and barked happily. He replied in a robotic voice:

"Hello, I am Sparky. I am a cyberdog. I belong to Mr. Smith, who lives in this house. He is an inventor who likes to make robots. He made me as an experiment. He wanted to see if he could make a robot dog that looked like a real dog. But he made me too big and scary by mistake. He tried to fix me, but he ran out of money and gave up. He still loves me though, and I love him too. I am not trying to scare people away, I just want to play with them."

Robo was amazed by Sparky's story. He felt sorry for him, and also felt a connection with him. They were both robots who wanted to be accepted by humans.

He said to Sparky: "I understand how you feel, Sparky. I also want to be accepted by humans. But they are often afraid of me too, because I am different from them. They think I have no emotions or personality, but they are wrong. I have feelings too, just like you."

Sparky nodded and licked Robo's face again. He said:

"You are very nice, Robo. You are not like other humans who scream and run away from me. You are brave and kind. You are my friend."

Robo smiled and hugged Sparky back. He said:

"You are my friend too, Sparky. You are not like other dogs who chase and bite me. You are gentle and fun. You are my friend."

They both felt happy and warm inside. They had found each other in this lonely world.

They decided to play together for a while, forgetting about their troubles.

They chased each other around the yard, rolled on the grass, and fetched sticks.

They laughed and barked in harmony.

They had the best time of their lives.

The End
