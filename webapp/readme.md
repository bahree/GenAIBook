    ```

5. **Set up environment variables:**

    Copy the [`.env-example`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2Fsrc%2FBook-GenAI%2FGenAIBook%2Fwebapp%2F.env-example%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\src\Book-GenAI\GenAIBook\webapp\.env-example") file to [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2Fsrc%2FBook-GenAI%2FGenAIBook%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\src\Book-GenAI\GenAIBook\.env") and update it with your own API keys and endpoints:

    ```sh
    cp .env-example .env
    ```

    Update the [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2Fsrc%2FBook-GenAI%2FGenAIBook%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\src\Book-GenAI\GenAIBook\.env") file with your own values:

    ```env
    OPEN_API_KEY=your-api-key
    OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo

    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-end-point.openai.azure.com/
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-05-01-preview
    AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-35-turbo
    ```

## Screenshots

ChatGPT-like Interface:
![](images/webapp_streamlit_chat.png)

Chat with Your Data:
We can upload a PDF and ask questions about its contents. For this example, we use the Women FIFA Worldcup PDF from Chapter 7. We create embeddings for the text and then ask questions about the content. If we ask a question that is not in the text, the AI will not be able to answer it.

Image Generation:
We can generate images using AI. For this example, we ask "a scenic boat ride with Seattle space needle in the backdrop in impressionist style".

![](images/webapp_streamlit_image_generation.png)

The image can be saved by clicking on the "Save Image" button. This will be saved in the "generated_images" folder, with the prompt and date as the filename.
