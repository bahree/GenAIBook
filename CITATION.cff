  Generative AI has created new opportunities for
  organizations of all sizes. You can easily use tools like
  ChatGPT, Bard, and Stable Diffusion to generate text and
  images for product catalogs, marketing campaigns,
  technical reporting, and other common tasks. Coding
  assistants like Copilot are accelerating productivity in
  software teams. In this insightful book, author Amit
  Bahree shares his experience leading Generative AI
  projects at Microsoft for nearly a decade, starting well
  before the current GPT revolution.
